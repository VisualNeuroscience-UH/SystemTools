Tools for CxSystem2 data science

These are additional tools for CxSystem2 repo data analysis and visualization. 

The idea is to put project specific methods to project folder. Project conf script file is inteded for use
by a non-programmer and project manager needs to be repurposed for distinct projects and it can
contain project-dependent hard coded stuff. Significant modification of the project manager module 
requires understanding of Python object-oriented programming.
