The noise file is the same, based on noise_210406.mat. Because the _ci file is dependent on input to E connections, 
we need to divide this to Single and Multi names for the two different _ci files.
Note added 17th Aug 2021: Changed NG3 to SS group. The connection_XX_ci.gz had to be updated due to changed NG name.
